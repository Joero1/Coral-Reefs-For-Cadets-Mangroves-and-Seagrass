  <p>Mangroves are trees that live partially submerged in saltwater. They have to be very specially adapted to deal with the stressors of tidal fluctuations, exposure to high salt concentration, anoxic sediment and high heat and ultraviolet intensity.</p>
    <p>Because mangroves live in intertidal zones where the water level fluctuates, they have to be adapted to being both submersed in salt water and exposed to air. They have special adaptations to deal with particular stressors.</p>

<p><strong>High Salinity</strong><br>
Salinity in mangrove swamps is particularly high because they contain stale shallow water exposed to intense heat from the sun. This causes a high rate of evaporation of water, leaving the salt behind. Unbalanced salt levels interferes with the charge of molecules in the organism. Many mangroves deal with this by having extra thick cell membranes around their root cells, thus limiting the amount of salt that enters the roots. Other mangrove species will take up the salt and then excrete it out of their bark and leaves, often leaving visible crystals. They may also divert the remaining salt to particular leaves that they will then deliberately sacrifice.</p> 

<p><strong>Water Limitation</strong><br>
Between the heat and the high salt levels, mangroves face the risk of extreme water loss. Mangroves have a thick waxy layer around their leaves called a ‘waxy cuticle’. This limits the rate of evaporation coming out of the leaves. Plants have pores in their leaves called ‘stomata’ that are needed for gas exchange. However, mangroves have fewer stomata than most plants as they also result in more water being lost from the leaf. They have particularly extensive root systems, and this helps to maximise water intake. Mangroves can alter the angle of their leaves to orient them away from direct sunlight, thus reducing evaporation even further.</p>

<p><strong>Unstable Sediment</strong><br>
Mangroves can only thrive in areas of low water activity. These are also areas where very fine sediment accumulates. This sediment is very easily stirred up, which makes it difficult for most plants to secure themselves. This is the main reason why mangroves have such extensive root systems that are relatively fast growing. They provide good anchorage keeping the tree stable.</p>
  
<p><strong>Anoxic Sediment</strong><br>
‘Anoxic’ means lacking in oxygen. Most trees get much of their oxygen from air pockets in the soil. But in mangrove swamps, the sediment is both fully submerged and incredibly fine, meaning it is almost entirely devoid of oxygen. Therefore mangroves have instead evolved to obtain more oxygen through the air. They obtain this through specialised pores in the bark. Many mangroves also have special snorkel-like structures protruding up from the roots called ‘pneumatophores’ that allow for extra obtaining of oxygen.</p>

<p><strong>Mangrove Reproduction</strong><br>
Mangrove seeds develop on the parent mangrove into ‘torpedo-like’ pods called propagules. When a propagule has a large enough nutrient reserve to cope with the upcoming stressors, it will detach from the parent and float in the water. It may drift for a large distance before hopefully settling. When the water is shallow enough the tip of the propagule should penetrate the settlement and start establishing roots. Propagule success is low so mangroves produce many propagules so that at least some will survive to full maturity.</p>

    <h2>Seagrass Beds</h2>
      <p>Sea grasses are the only 'true' plant group (i.e. not algae) that can live fully submerged in salt water. Unlike mangroves, which live exlusively in the tropics and sub-tropics, sea grass beds can be found in both tropical and temperatre latitudes. However, in the tropics they harbour significantly richer biological communities.</p>
  <p>A typical undisturbed tropical coastal ecosystem will be commonly be structured with mangroves lining the coast, leading into a seagrass bed in the shallows, eventually transitioning into a coral reef. This is significant because there is a huge amount of ecological connectivity between the three habitats. In fact, about 80% of reef fish migrate to mangroves at some point in their life cycle. When mangroves or seagrass beds are destroyed, there is a huge knock-on effect on the health of neighbouring coral reefs. But why?...</p>  
  <p>Seagrasses are not actually grass. Unlike true grass, seagrasses are <strong>angiosperms</strong> (flowering plants). The pollen of seagrass can be carried effectively by ocean currents. Seagrasses are restricted to shallow waters because they require a very high amount of sunlight for photosynthesis. Seagrass blades may appear as being individual organisms, but in truth, many blades will belong to the same individual, connected by an underground ‘stem’ called a <strong>rhizome</strong>.</p>

      <h2>The Importance of Mangroves and Seagrass Beds</h2>
      <p><strong>Fish Nurseries</strong>
        <br>Mangroves, and to some extent sea grass beds, serve as nurseries for juvenile fish. They can start their life in a refuge where it is hard for larger predators to fit between the dense network of roots. Once they grow larger and less vulnerable they then migrate onto the reef.</p>
  <p><strong>Coastal Protection</strong>
        <br>Mangroves provide a great deal of coastal protection from storm damage. After the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami in the Indo-Pacific, surveys demonstrated that locations that still had mangrove forests present had far less infrastructural ddamage than areas that had lost their mangroves to deforestation.</p>
      <p><strong>Sediment Stabilisation</strong>
        <br>Mangroves and seagrass thrive in areas where the sediment is highly fine and silty. This kind of sediment easily wafts about in the water. Coral does not thrive well in waters with high sediment as it can reduce sunlight and smother their feeding appendages. Mangroves and seagrass both have extensive roots that help to lock-in this sediment to prevent it from running onto the reef. When mangroves are deforested, one of the side-effects is an increase in turbidity (i.e. particulate matter in the water) on coral reefs.</p>

  <p><strong>Blue Carbon</strong>
        <br>Both habitats are an excellent store of what is referred to as 'blue carbon'. This is a modern term used to describe carbon storage associated with a marine environment. A meter squared of mangrove forest is actually a more efficient carbon sink than a meter squared of tropical rainforest.</p>
      <p><strong>Water Oxygenation</strong>
        <br>As both mangroves and seagrass carry out photosynthesis, they contribute towards oxygenation in the water. This is crucial to marine life as almost all living things require oxygen for respiration.</p>
      <p><strong>Nutrient Sink</strong>
        <br>Coral reefs need water with low nutrient levels so that they are not outcompeted by algae. Many of the nutrients in the sea has leached from the land. Where mangroves and seagrass are present, they mitigate the nutrient run-off from the land by absorbing a large amount of it before it reaches the reef.</p>
      <p><strong>Habitat for Many Species</strong>
        <br>Mangroves and seagrass beds are habitats for many species in their own right. This includes a number of charismatic marine species, such as manatees which feed on the grass, and terrestrial species such as birds, bugs and reptiles. They therefore serve as a link between the marine ecosystem and the terrestrial ecosystem, thus enhancing connectivity and flow within the 'global ecosystem'.</p>
